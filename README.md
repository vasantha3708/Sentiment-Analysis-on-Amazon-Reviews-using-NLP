## Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews using NLP

# Task

* Dataset : 400 thousand reviews of unlocked mobile phones sold on Amazon.com
* Problem : Sentiment analysis for Amazon product reviews
* Use Natural Language Procesisng techniques, Bag of Words model, Word2Vec model and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to conduct sentiment analysis for Amazon product reviews.
* Accuracy score of 94.4% by Word2Vec embedding with LSTM.

## Steps:

* Part 1. Data Exploration
* Part 2. Data Preparation
* Part 3. Bag of Words
* Part 4. Word2Vec
* Part 5. LSTM
* Part 6. Word Cloud 

* Data visualization of Amazon product reviews
* Preprocess raw reviews to cleaned reviews
* Use different word embedding models, such as count vectorizer, tf-idf transformation and Word2Vec model, to transform text reviews into numerical representations
* Fit numerical representations of text reviews to LSTM (a type of recurrent neural network)
